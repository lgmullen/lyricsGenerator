Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over
I don't really care if you cry

Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out 
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "I am not afraid to die" 
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge 
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah

That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em 
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some 
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll
She say, "You're the worst, you're the worst"
I cannot die because this my universe
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Hello

It go like
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things 
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain 
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing 
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it
I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her 
Go over there with that broke fella 
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather, ooh 
My new chick I swear that she better, ooh
Want me back, never 
That's true , that's right 
She's sipping Moët, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter 
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder 
No, I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar 
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together 
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header

But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
I know it hurts sometimes , but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I swear that you'll get over it 
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
