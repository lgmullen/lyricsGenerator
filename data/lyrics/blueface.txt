I ain't never had a school award 
Spent fifty thousand on a watch 
And it came with an appraisal 
Put a hole in a nigga 
Now he looking like a bagel 
How could I ever go broke 
If Cash Money is the label? 
Bleed the block in a minivan 
Like I came to fix the cable
Man, ain't it a great feeling? Damn
Beat the odds, now I get paid for the evening
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down 
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down 
Bustdown Cuban , fuck it, bust the Uzi 
Smoking on a cookie and I made the air polluted 
I can fit a whole hundred racks in the Ksubis 
I been getting money since a young nigga, juvie 
Look at how I drip, Austin Powers, groovy 
12 get behind me, bust a left, then a U-ey 
Diamonds get to hitting and they splashin' on the Louis 
Thick bad bitch on the ’Gram and I flew it 
Bust down the watch, I'ma bust down your thot 
Thirty round Glock case a nigga try to plot 
Lamborghini drop-top, flexing on the opp 
I'm a walking zombie when I'm sippin' on the Wock' 
Trapping out the bando 
Get the work, make the profit, buy a Range Rover 
When I got my first mil', it was game over 
Had to go and pop the seal, now the pain over 
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down 
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down 
I need half upfront 
The other half when I touch down 
Can’t do nothing without the backend 
Bae just want me in her back-end 
Keep sticks on me like a caddie 
But you will never catch me lacking 
I pulled up in a big Benz 
I keep a stick like an old man 
Bae just want her a rich man 
I’m in the area like Richmond 
Always had me a vision
But this ain't That’s So Raven 
Bitch, I fly like a raven 
I bought her more like the Ravens 
Chopper make a nigga breakdance 
Paint his brain on the pavement
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down 
Used to ride the bus down 
Now I wear a bustdown 
I just made six like a touchdown 
I need it all when I touch down

I always keep a hard pole for a hater 
Two dicks, I'm with the full-fledged bullshit

Bruce Lee wearin' kicks fly, now this Glock kickin'
Pop up least expected, like a mention
Niggas want beef 'til I bring it to they kitchen
It's all fun and games 'til I pull up to your block trippin'
Curry in the clip but I'm shootin' like Scottie Pippen
Hot sauce, no drive-by, bounced out and walked up
Taped off, stop the cappin', you niggas all talk

Twenty or better just for me to walk through 
Red bottoms, but I'm painting them blue
These ain't Louis Vuittons, these Christian Loubs
Bar Mitzvah on me, nothin' but jewels
Baguettes, guaranteed I'm getting his boo
Baby blowin' dick just like a flute
Mmh-mmh-mmh, ooh, ooh
Play with the dick just like peek-a-boo 
Walk in the club and I pick a boo 
Fuck 'em both 'cause I don't wanna choose 
They gon' holler for a dollar 
Fuck it, I'm rich, bitch 
I bought the ugly Balenciagas
Prada always fix the problem
Glock knock him out, designer
First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes, guaranteed I'm getting his boo
Ooh, ooh, baby, blow it like soup
I'm so hot, I get paid to be cool
First class what I spent on the shoes

DM your main bitch and tell that bitch she can have me
Fire head, run that, the pussy weak, punt that
Thick bitches, love that, been there, done that

No athlete, that good dick gon' make a bitch run laps
Blow a bitch back out, fuck her 'til she tap out

Tired of my main, she tired of my side
Rather work nine-to-five then to get nine to five
Strippin' at eighteen, you ain't even tried 
Niggas send subs instead of subscribe
Dick in her mouth, she swallow my pride
She came with the girls, I came with the guys
Ha-ha, it's nothin' but
Vibe , vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Marble floors, blue couches 
One hit wonder, how I got two houses? 
Two is a vibe, three is crowded
Not me and you, but me and two bitches
Ha-ha-ha, silly
I'm gettin' top in the car 
She sucked the dick-hole through the dick hole
In the Louis drawers, but it was gucci
Drive the boat, one hand on her coochie
I walk in the bank, they happy to see me
Take out a hundred, post it on IG, ha-ha-ha
Vibe , vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
I put the G in Wagen
Your ho get inside, then I get inside 
Lay the backseats down, baby, vibes
Only designer in my design
Don't pay for no pussy, can't even spend time 
I don't have to dine to make a bitch whine
They want me dead , get in line
Money on my head, one in the head
Put 'em to bed 
She suckin' dick while it's dead soft
Couple vibes in the loft 
Ha-ha-ha, where they at? 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha 
Vibe , vibe , vibe , ha-ha-ha-ha

Headache, they really tried to bleed a Crip

Let a nigga trip, I go man into boogie 
All black hoodie, Glock sing like A Boogie 
Big MAC, boy, this bitch spittin' loogies 
It's hard to dance with two dicks, bitch, I boogie 
Let a nigga trip, I go man into boogie 
All black hoodie, Glock sing like A Boogie 
Big MAC, boy, this bitch spittin' loogies 
Yup, these niggas know what time it is
40 on me, if you wanna trip, I'm gon' use it
Stop playin', I'm on the bullshit with my opposition
Pull up, spark somethin', man down, ain't no competition
Big arms on me, up the blower if you get to walkin' down
Took him back to preschool, they done chalked him out
Ain't no gun stuffed in his MCM backpack
Bitches be ducks, I had to call my nigga Aflac
Flocked some houses with my niggas, then I came up
Outside gettin' the dough, you better keep your chain tucked
I'm probably posted in your set, trippin' with my lil' cuz
Leave a pussy in the sky when I really let that thing bust
It's hard to dance with two dicks, bitch, I boogie 
Let a nigga trip, I go man into boogie 
All black hoodie, Glock sing like A Boogie 
Big MAC, boy, this bitch spittin' loogies 
It's hard to dance with two dicks, bitch, I boogie 
Let a nigga trip, I go man into boogie

Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka
Put a blower to his gums like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka
Put a blower to his gums like Bazooka

Up the MAC, make this bitch sing like Luther
My Glock hate niggas, like the Ku Klux
I keep two dicks, so I can give two fucks
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I got it on my own, I'm grown, I stay alone
Just beat it when I get home
We can't fuck if you ain't got no arch
My life a movie, baby, just play your part
Used to have to push the Benz, now my Benz push-to-start
Keep the beef in the oven, just push to start
Keep a 40 fatter than Paul Blart
Catch a nigga slippin' and I'm slidin' like I'm at the park
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka
Put a blower to his gums like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka
Put a blower to his gums like Bazooka
I won't let you niggas trick me out my spot
I'm too cocky, baby, 'cause I gotta keep two cocks
I don't need no shooters, janky baby, don't let the look fool ya
40 like diarrhea, bet it go right through ya
Put blower to his gums like Bazooka
Thirty in the clip instead of thirty trooper 
One shot clear out a parking lot
I'm all bite, you niggas just bark a lot
I will never change
I remain the same, but we are not the same
I got everything to lose, you got everything to gain
You do it for the fame, I did it for the gang
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka
Put a blower to his gums like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own
I don't need no shooter

Benz truck, no tint, came with the blinds up
Got this bad bitch goin' down with her eyes up

Shots to the face, no chaser
Fuck a fade, I'm only givin' out tapers 
Woke up early just to slide on you later 
I always keep a hard pole for a hater 
Two dicks, I'm with the full-fledged bullshit
