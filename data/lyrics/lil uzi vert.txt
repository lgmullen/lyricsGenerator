Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it
I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her 
Go over there with that broke fella 
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather, ooh

Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a note 
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
I got your girl and you already know 
Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker

Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring

We was in Hawaii lookin' at the ring 
She smilin' happy, but I'm laughin' 'cause her man's a lame
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing 
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothin' left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it
See I tied up my Raf, you strapped up your Rick 
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist 
Complement my style 
She don't want me, I'm runnin' wild 
You know I respect her on that level 
She don't want me, then I'ma let her 
Go over there with that broke fella 
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather

Drop it in the bowl, it's lockin' 
Straight up out the 6, I'm cocky 
Almost went hollow off on Austin 
Block get hot like Takis 
I'ma dope-boy, you a jockey 
None of y'all niggas can stop me 
Fuckin' with the Crips, on God-y 
Bitch, don't spit, just swallow it 
Hit your baby mama, she follow me 
Hit him with the stick, he hollerin' 
21 Al-Qaeda, I'm Taliban 
Y'all lil' niggas be gossipin' 
Y'all fly Spirit, I'm charterin' 
Yessirski

And you didn't come here for me, let's talk about it
'Cause if you would have came here for me, that would've been planned
You would've put me on
You ain't say, "Oh I'm coming this day, I'm coming that"
You sit here and you tell me one thing and you always do another
'Cause, cause let me know, let me... let me tell you why
'Cause you're not a man of your word
That's - that's the reason why. So let's talk about it
Oh, you come here for nothing
No, you came here for what?
Whatever you came here for
So, whatever
You have no type of communication at all
So get up out my comments
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall, yeah 
They predicted next fall yeah 
Look at them, like, "Aw yeah" 
Talk to me 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Or don't talk to me at all, yeah 
On the way, one call yeah 
Count it up and it's all there 
Water hittin' look like small tears 
Told her talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
I say it once , I won't say it twice 
Okay might say it twice , because I'm kinda high 
Even though I'm so evil , I still look at the sky
And I ask why
Why I treat her like my dog, yeah
We supposed to be all here 
She got different color long hair
Pull up coupe, two small chairs 
Took that girl right in the club 
Felt the booty and it's all there
So smooth so its all nair
Heard she talk to a ball player , It's cool
Heard she talk to a ball player, but you know I keep it all player
And I heard he ain't a star player
I'm not worried, I'm a heartbreaker
I'm in outer space, on Mars faded
I'm not tryna make it R-rated 
But my niggas look like Darth Vader 
Ohh, ohh
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall, yeah 
They predicted next fall yeah 
Look at them, like, "Aw yeah" 
Talk to me 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Or don't talk to me at all, yeah 
On the way, one call yeah 
Count it up and it's all there 
Water hittin' look like small tears 
I was in a dream 
Yeah I used to dream 
I was all a dream 
Now I'm in reality, don't need those
Fantasy, what I see, sleep when I'm woke 
Real ones can't die , only multiply 
I know something it ain't right , how you put me to the side? 
When I called your phone, yeah, you said I was lyin' 
How am I lyin'?  I just pulled up to my show 
I'm still on the grind
Heard you got a chauffeur 
Talk to me nice,  talk to me nice 
Heard she a Doll when she mad, why I flood her all in ice 
Ride it like a bike, bust me like a Sprite
Load up the jet for New York tonight
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall, yeah 
They predicted next fall yeah 
Look at them, like, "Aw yeah" 
Talk to me 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Talk to me nice 
Or don't talk to me at all, yeah 
On the way, one call yeah 
Count it up and it's all there 
Water hittin' look like small tears 
Talk to me

Bro got the 9, I got the 4 tucked 
Niggas wanna keep talkin', they gotta show us 
Pull up in a Rolls same color as pour-up 
Told her bend right over, do the toe-touch 
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus 
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin 
This a UZI, not a MAC, I got no pin
I bet you couldn't tell the difference and that girl a gem 
Gucci pants come out the Gucci store, come with a hem 
My pants, they so tight, don't know if they for her or him 
Niggas want my style, I got some swag that you can lend 
Balenciaga with the Prada, still rock Phillip Lim 
Louis bandana tied around my chin 
Gosha socks, them bitches pulled up all the way to my shin 
Yes, I'm off a 30, psych, nah, I just took three 10s
We rock spinners, we rock spinners on my rims 
You sucker niggas do anything cause y'all wanna win 
Oh, no, no, I won't fold, I won't bend
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus 
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin 
No, I don't drink lean, but pour that four up 
I get so high that I might throw up 
They keep judging me, but I'm like so what? 
Yeah, let's get geeked, girl, let's load up 
I bet these niggas never thought I'd blow up 
Yeah, so much check but I get more bucks 
That nigga mad because his bitch still chose us 
I got her tweakin' on the six, she goin' nuts 
Yeah, she goin' nuts 
She said "How the diamonds on your neck so polar?" 
Baby, my ice on my neck can't get no colder 
And I'm from outer space, top of my Wraith so solar 
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus
I see my opps again, I gotta load up 
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent 
Got her rubbin' on my skin
